	/*
	 * A tree can have any numbers of child nodes i.e. 1,2 or many.
	 * A Binary tree is a tree with left and right child nodes.
	 * Full binary tree: It is a binary tree where each node have either 0 or 2 child nodes.
	 * Perfect binary tree: It is a binary tree where all child nodes are at same level.
	 * Complete binary tree: It is a binary tree that is completely filled from left to right.
	 * Parent node: A node that act as parent to other nodes is called a parent node.
	 * Leaf nodes: Terminal child nodes that don't have child are called leaf nodes.
	 * Binary search tree is a tree that contains nodes having value less than parent at left and nodes having value more than parent at the right.
	 * All nodes at left have value less than the parent node and all nodes at right have value more than parent node in BST.
	 * Number of nodes in BST=2^steps-1
	 * BST=O(log n)=Divide & conquer
	 * BST=O(n) in case of a tree having nodes only at the right or left without binary split. This is a corner case.
	 * lookup(),insert(),remove() have O(log n)
	 * insert() is faster for linked list O(1) as compared to BST O(log n)
	 * lookup() is faster for BST O(log n) as compared to linked list O(n)
	 * remove() is faster for BST O(log n) as compared to linked list O(n)
